### UMCS Required Directories:
- **SYS-CONF**: Contains universal configurations for many applications and exploits.
- **BOOT**: Contains the heart of UMCS, contains essential ELFs and their local settings.
- **B?EXEC-SYSTEM**: PS2BBL Exploit relevant to your console(s) region(s).
- **FMCBD-1.??**, or **OSDMENU**: At least one of the three available boots to land on. Otherwise you will only have the option to hold start to access wLaucnhELF.

## Configuration & Boot Order:
By default, the boot sequence searches in this order:

1. **FMCB 1.966** *(Recommended for most users)*  
   - If working, you may safely delete FMCB 1.953, RESTART, and POWEROFF.

2. **FMCB 1.953** *(Fallback if 1.966 fails due to modchips or hardware incompatibilities)*
   - If 1.966 fails, delete it to automatically revert to 1.953.

3. **OSDMENU** *(Alternative launcher if both FMCB versions fail)*
   - If both FMCB versions are incompatible, delete them to activate OSDMENU automatically.

### Emergency Access:
If all three primary boot options fail:
- Hold `Start` during boot to launch **wLaunchELF_EXFAT-MMCE** (BOOT2.ELF).
- Modify launch order or applications via:
  - `mc?:/SYS-CONF/PS2BBL.INI`
  - `mc?:/BOOT/CONFIG.INI`
  - `mc?:/SYS-CONF/PSXBBL.INI`
- Alternative launchers (e.g., `mc?:/NEUTRINO/nhddl.elf`) can be configured using wLaunchELF's built-in text editor.

### Additional Notes:
- Applications are accessible if installed; however, removing unused applications via the PS2 Browser (Memory Card Icon Screen) is recommended to free space.
- Customize boot preferences by editing `mc?:/SYS-CONF/PS2BBL.INI`.
- PSX consoles (PSX-DESR) default to launching wLaunchELF (configured via `PSXBBL.INI`).
- OSDMENU settings (`OSDMENU.CNF`) can be customized via wLaunchELF.

### Compatibility with Late PS2 Slim Models:
Install any form of update, and then launch the included OpenTuna installer to gain access to your UMCS installation.

# üìÇ HOW TO INSTALL ‚Äì SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS

Welcome! Follow the steps below carefully to set everything up.  
No need to change, rename, or move anything outside of what‚Äôs explained here.

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT YOU'LL NEED:

- One **SD card** (exfat/fat32 mbr)
- One **MMCE Device** (sd2psxtd/MemCard Pro 2/etc)
- One **USB drive**  (exfat/fat32 mbr)
  > Must be formatted as **FAT32** or **exFAT** with **MBR (Master Boot Record)**  
  > Need help formatting? Use [rufus.ie](https://rufus.ie) ‚Äî it‚Äôs simple and free.

---

## üì• STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

### 1. Prepare the SD Card

- Insert your **SD card** into your computer.
- Open it to view its contents ‚Äî this is the **"root"** of the SD card.
- Now open the folder named: `!COPY TO SD!` (the one you're reading this in)
- Inside, you‚Äôll see folders like:
  - `APPS`
  - `BOOT`
  - `NEUTRINO`
  - (others, if included)

‚û°Ô∏è **Copy all of these folders** and **paste them directly onto the SD card root**.  
> Do **not** put them in another folder.

üîÅ If asked **"Do you want to replace or merge folders?"** click **YES**, **REPLACE**, or **MERGE** ‚Äì that‚Äôs okay.

Once done, **safely eject the SD card**.

---

### 2. Prepare the USB Drive

- Insert your **USB drive** into your computer.
- **Do not change the folder structure** of the KELFBinder installer package.
- Simply **copy the entire installer package as-is** (all files and folders) to the **root of your USB drive**.

> The USB should now contain:
> - `KELFBinder.elf`
> - All included related installer files/folders it came with
> - No extra folders or rearrangements

Once done, **safely eject the USB drive**.

---

## üß© FINAL STEP ‚Äì INSTALL UMCS

1. Plug both the **SD card** into your MMCE device and the **USB drive** into your PS2.

2. On your device, **run `KELFBinder.elf` from the USB drive**.  
   > This will start the UMCS installation which will expect the files from the SD card to be present on your MMCE device.

---

## ‚ùå DON'T DO THIS:

- ‚ùå Don‚Äôt copy the `!COPY TO SD!` folder itself ‚Äî only its **contents**.
- ‚ùå Don‚Äôt move any installer files from the USB package.
- ‚ùå Don‚Äôt rename or delete anything.
- ‚ùå Don‚Äôt put the installer on the SD card ‚Äî it **must** run from USB.

---
