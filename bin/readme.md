- One **MMCE Device** (sd2psxtd/MemCard Pro 2/etc)
- One **USB drive**  (exfat/fat32 mbr)

## 📥 STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

### 1. Prepare the SD Card

- Insert your **SD card** into your computer.
- Open it to view its contents — this is the **"root"** of the SD card.
- Now open the folder named: `!COPY TO SD!` (the one you're reading this in)
- Inside, you’ll see folders like:
  - `APPS`
  - `BOOT`
  - `NEUTRINO`
  - (others, if included)

➡️ **Copy all of these folders** and **paste them directly onto the SD card root**.  
> Do **not** put them in another folder.

🔁 If asked **"Do you want to replace or merge folders?"** click **YES**, **REPLACE**, or **MERGE** – that’s okay.

Once done, **safely eject the SD card**.

### 2. Prepare the USB Drive

- Insert your **USB drive** into your computer.
- **Do not change the folder structure** of the KELFBinder installer package.
- Simply **copy the entire installer package as-is** (all files and folders) to the **root of your USB drive**.

> The USB should now contain:
> - `KELFBinder.elf`
> - All included related installer files/folders it came with
> - No extra folders or rearrangements

Once done, **safely eject the USB drive**.

## 🧩 FINAL STEP – INSTALL UMCS

1. Plug both the **SD card** into your MMCE device and the **USB drive** into your PS2.

2. On your device, **run `KELFBinder.elf` from the USB drive**.  
   > This will start the UMCS installation which will expect the files from the SD card to be present on your MMCE device.

---

## ❌ DON'T DO THIS:

- ❌ Don’t copy the `!COPY TO SD!` folder itself — only its **contents**.
- ❌ Don’t move any installer files from the USB package.
- ❌ Don’t rename or delete anything.
- ❌ Don’t put the installer on the SD card — it **must** run from USB.
